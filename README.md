# Movie-Genre-Prediction
This project was developed as part of CSE 573(Data Intensive Computing) course in 2020.


The project focuses on using Spark Libraries to implement an end to end Predictive Analytics Pipeline which implements a movie genre prediction model. The dataset contains information about movies with attributes such as movie id, movie name, plot and genre. The goal is to predict all the genres of a particular movie based on the plot summaries.
There are 20 distinct genre categories and about 31k rows of data for training, 7k rows for testing. Each movie can have multiple genres.
